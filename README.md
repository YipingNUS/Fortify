# Urge Surfing

Instead of turning away from the urge, experiment with turning toward the urge. Try pushing back and watching your experience like a movie. As best you can, stay curious, calm and present to whatever you’re noticing– paying attention to both your surroundings and what’s going on inside – thoughts, feelings and physical sensations.

If you watch long enough, you might notice something pretty surprising:  the urge changes and eventually passes.

# Bouncing the Eyes

When something triggering comes into our line of sight – especially out of the blue – what about getting good at that ninja skill of Turning Away – or what some people call “bouncing the eyes.”

Instead of letting the eyes linger, what if we learned to literally bounce the eyes like a ball away from what we don’t want to see?  

As simple as it sounds, this skill can be honed, polished and refined as a killer move powerful enough to cut using off at the pass.
